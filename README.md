This project is a  simple dashboard for managing shopping and ecommerce activity. 

## Application Features
-Auction
-Project listing.
-Events.


 ### How I will improve more on this application:

##### - If giving more time and incentives for this project, I would integrate all API endpoints and ensure they work properly.





#### I am also currently doing refactoring of the application and improving more on the design and functionality. 

### The application is also fully deploy and hosted on Netlify. Live view of the application Demo can be found here- [React Calendar App](https://)
